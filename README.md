# Data_Analytics

In this section I will be going through some case studies and implement basic pandas and visualization skills in order to practice the syntaxes and libraries.
The case studies may come from contributors via Youtube or other channels, and or case studies that I have thought off.

The flow of this data analytics case studies are:
1. Data Cleaning and Processing
2. Answering Questions

Key takeaways:
- Accessing dataframe using .loc and .iloc
- Groupby function
- Visualization using Matplotlib or Seaborn
